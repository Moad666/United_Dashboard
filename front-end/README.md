## Feature Development Workflow

To ensure efficient collaboration and maintain code quality, please follow the feature development workflow outlined below:

### 1. Create a Branch for Each Feature

- Create a new branch for each feature using the following naming convention: `feat/{feature-name}-{developer-name}`.

### 2. Associate Branch with Jira Ticket

- Associate the created branch with the corresponding Jira ticket by adding the branch link to the ticket.

### 3. Move Jira Ticket to Review Column

- Once the branch is associated with the ticket, move the Jira ticket to the "Review" column.

### 4. Send Pull Request for Code Review

- Send a pull request from your feature branch to the code owner's branch for review before merging.

### 5. Resolve Conflicts and Ensure CI/CD Pipeline

- Resolve any conflicts that arise during the code review process.
- Verify that the CI/CD pipeline is running smoothly and all tests are passing.

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline Template

Before merging your code, make sure to follow the CI/CD template created in the main branch. Ensure there are no issues at any stage of the pipeline before proceeding with the merge.

By following these steps and adhering to the CI/CD template, we can streamline our development process and maintain code quality throughout the project. Thank you for your cooperation!
